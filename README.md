# Capacity-Calculator-Project
A building capacity calculator using Omron Thermal Sensors.  It was created as the
final project for Internet of Everything (ENGN0931).  Contact me for more info.

Sensors: Omron D6T-44L Thermal Sensors

OneSensorConnection.ino is the arduino file to communicate with the sensor.
It was adapted from another person's version (anon) to fit and work with my specific sensor.

The website code and algorithm were written by me.  Because the sensors were not usable
until after the project was due, it mimics data input from a server using javascript.
